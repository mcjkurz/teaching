## Visualizations

### Softmax Temperature
- **Demo**: https://mcjkurz.github.io/teaching/visualizations/softmax-temperature.html
- Path: `/visualizations/softmax-temperature.html`
- Shows how temperature affects probability distributions in language models
- Interactive temperature slider with real-time updates

### Cosine Similarity
- **Demo**: https://mcjkurz.github.io/teaching/visualizations/cosine-similarity.html
- Path: `/visualizations/cosine-similarity.html`
- Interactive visualization of cosine similarity between two vectors
- Drag vectors around the unit circle to see real-time similarity calculations

### Attention Mechanism: Keys and Queries
- **Demo**: https://mcjkurz.github.io/teaching/visualizations/attention-keys-queries.html
- Path: `/visualizations/attention-keys-queries.html`
- Interactive visualization of the attention mechanism in transformer models
- Drag the query vector to see how attention scores change for each key vector
