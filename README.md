## Visualizations

### 2D Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Demo**: https://mcjkurz.github.io/teaching/visualizations/pca-2d.html
- Step-by-step interactive walkthrough of PCA
- Covers: data centering, covariance matrix, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, variance ellipse, and projection
- Click to add points or generate sample datasets

### Cosine Similarity
- **Demo**: https://mcjkurz.github.io/teaching/visualizations/cosine-similarity.html
- Interactive visualization of cosine similarity between two vectors
- Drag vectors to see real-time similarity calculations

### Attention Mechanism: Keys and Queries
- **Demo**: https://mcjkurz.github.io/teaching/visualizations/attention-keys-queries.html
- Interactive visualization of the attention mechanism in transformers
- Drag the query vector to see how attention scores change

### Softmax Temperature
- **Demo**: https://mcjkurz.github.io/teaching/visualizations/softmax-temperature.html
- Shows how temperature affects probability distributions in language models
- Interactive temperature slider with real-time updates
